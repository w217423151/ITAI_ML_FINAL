It uses the logistic (sigmoid) function to convert linear combinations of the predictors into values between 0 and 1, allowing the model to make probability-based decisions.

For each instance, it averages the predicted probabilities of the positive class from selected base models. The final prediction for an instance is then determined by comparing this averaged probability to a threshold (e.g., 0.5). This approach helps to smooth out individual model biases and can lead to more robust predictions, especially when the base models are diverse but perform well.\n",
